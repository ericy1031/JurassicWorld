# Jurassic World Project
This project was focused on use of C++ to implement the original java code. The code should take in the data given to it in the main file and output the correct responses.

## How It's Made
**Technology used:** C++, VS code

The creation of this project required a better understanding of C++ and how it relates to java. I used header files to substitute the different classes in the Java file.

## Lessons Learned
With the project, I was able to learn proper syntax for C++ programming. As well as the use and implementation of header files.
